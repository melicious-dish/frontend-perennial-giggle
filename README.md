# Perennial Pickle Frontend

### Motivation ###
Taking care of plants is hard. How much water do they need? What kind of fertilizer is best for this varietal? How much has my garden grown since I started it? This was the motivation behind this project -- to build an app that will help the user care for their plants and see their garden's progress over time. The app will eventually notify the user when the plants need care (watering schedule, repotting, etc). There will also be a feature to compile photos the user has taken of the plants and create a timelapse video of the images to see the progress over time.

### Tech/framework used ###
React Native
 * Redux
 * Thunk
 * React Native Router

Firebase
 * Auth
 * Realtime Database

### Dev notes ####
  * Use node.js for backend
  * Tried out Redux. It's difficult but going to push through and use it for the rest of the app.
  * Used Firebase for authenticaion -- straight forward
  * Styling:
      * Look at emotion

 * Simplify my app. 
   * work on front end: 
     * adding a user 
     * adding plants 
     * adding tasks 
     * adding photos

* Used Thunk for asynchronous action creators (firebase, ajax, etc)
* Use React Native Router (react-native-router-flux) for navigation
