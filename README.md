# perennial-giggle-front

### Dev notes ####
  * Use node.js for backend
  * Tried out Redux. It's difficult but going to push through and use it for the rest of the app.
  * Used Firebase for authenticaion -- straight forward
  * Styling:
      * Look at emotion

 * Simplify my app. 
   * work on front end: 
     * adding a user 
     * adding plants 
     * adding tasks 
     * adding photos

* Used Thunk for asynchronous action creators (firebase, ajax, etc)
